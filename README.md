# DAFX-AntiAliasing
Companion page to the paper "Reducing the aliasing of nonlinear waveshaping using continuous-time convolution", presented at the DAFx16 Conference in Brno, Czech Republic, 5th-9th Sept. 2016.

### code/
Contains MATLAB scripts implementing antialiased hardclipper, as described in paper. Also included is the code used to calculate SNR values given in paper.

### sounds/
Contains sound examples of the methods applied to a hard clipping nonlinearity, and inside a nonlinear ladder filter model.
